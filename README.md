![Distribution](https://cdn.iconscout.com/icon/free/png-512/distribution-29-1146710.png)

Tool that can be used to assign topics for school assignments.

The basic idea:
- students are added to a database via interface
- topics are added via interface
- via the same interface a shuffle operation is started
- students are distributed in groups of 3 and one of 4 for when it's an odd number

__This way the groups will be made on a random matter.__
